 \textit{The Brain Computer Interface (BCI) applications present a growing development due to increase researchers interesting about the subject. One of the main step in BCI development is the brain signals classification, wich are then translate into controls commands for any device. Some classifiers have characteristics of linearity, not requaring a high computational performance for their execution, wich allow its implementation in embedded systems. Thus, this work present a comparative study between implementation of the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier training algorithm, in harware and software, using the SoC of the Zynq family embedded in the development kit Zybo-board.}
